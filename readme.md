## 🎬 Machine Learning Specialization – Stanford University (Coursera)

**Completed:** September 2024 – November 2024  
**Instructor:** Andrew Ng, Aarti Bagul, Geoff Ladwig, Eddy Shyu

This specialization provided a comprehensive introduction to modern machine learning, covering foundational algorithms, practical implementations, and advanced topics such as recommender systems and reinforcement learning. Through hands-on coding assignments and real-world datasets, I built and trained machine learning models using both classic and deep learning techniques.
